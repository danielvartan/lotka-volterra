This repository contains a demonstration of the [Lotka–Volterra's model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations), originally developed by Alfred J. Lotka ([1925](http://archive.org/details/elementsofphysic017171mbp)) and Vito Volterra ([1926](https://www.nature.com/articles/118558a0)), to describe the dynamics of biological systems where two species interact: one as a predator and the other as prey. The report is available [here](https://danielvartan.github.io/lotka–volterra/).
